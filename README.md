N Queens Problem Case Study using Z3

queen.py generates the smt files
nqueen.py is the standard backttracking solution.
execute.py will execute the smt files and store the output in a txt file. NOTE: To run this file, give the correct location of z3.
generate_images.py will read the output text files and generate a image of the N*N board. It is better to visualise the output this way, than reading it though the output txt files.
